# Custom G-code Generator

**Custom G-code Generator** is a project I built out of frustration with the limitations of conventional 3D printing software‚Äîespecially its strict reliance on flat, uniform layers.

I developed this tool as part of my Bachelor's thesis to enable advanced print path design beyond standard capabilities. It supports:

- Non-planar layer generation  
- Variable extrusion widths  
- Stationary extrusion points  
- Interactive path visualization
- and more...  

By removing the constraint of flat-layer slicing, it unlocks new possibilities for complex and creative 3D prints.

The project is fully written in Python and includes an interactive visualization system, allowing users to precisely control and preview their print paths before printing.

## üîç How to Navigate the Project

While the codebase is well-documented, users primarily interested in functionality should start with the `/design` folder. It contains the key functions and modules for generating custom paths.

Feel free to explore and customize it to suit your printing needs!
